Q1. What is a database? Differentiate between SQL and NoSQL databases. 
Ans.-Database is a kind of container that is used to store, update and retrieve the information.
     SQL stands for Structured Query Language.In this data has been stored in a structured way in the form of table while NoSQL stands for        Not only SQL. In this data can be stored in a non-structured way like we can store images, video, animation and many more.

Q2. What is DDL? Explain why CREATE, DROP, ALTER, and TRUNCATE are used with an example. 
Ans. A data definition language (DDL) is a computer language used to create and modify the structure of database objects in a database.          These database objects include views, schemas, tables, indexes, etc.
     CREATE- This command builds a new table and has a predefined syntax. The CREATE statement syntax is:

              CREATE TABLE [table name] ([column definitions]) [table parameters];

                For example:

                CREATE TABLE Employee (Employee Id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, First name CHAR (50) NULL, Last name CHAR (75) NOT NULL);

     DROP- A drop command is used to delete objects such as a table, index or view. A DROP statement cannot be rolled back, so once an       object is destroyed, there’s no way to recover it.

               Drop statement syntax is:

           DROP object type object name;

          For example:

          DROP TABLE Employee;

         In this example, we’re deleting the Employee table.

        ALTER-An alter command modifies an existing database table. This command can add up additional column, drop existing columns and even change the data type of columns involved in a database table.

         An alter command syntax is:

        ALTER object type object name parameters;

        For example:

         ALTER TABLE Employee ADD PRIMARY KEY (employee_pk);

           In this example, we added a unique primary key to the table to add a constraint and enforce a unique value. The constraint “employee_pk” is a primary key and is on the Employee table
           
 TRUNCATE-Similar to DROP, the TRUNCATE statement is used to quickly remove all records from a table. However, unlike DROP that completely destroys a table, TRUNCATE preserves its full structure to be reused later.

Truncate statement syntax is:

TRUNCATE TABLE table_name;

For example:

TRUNCATE TABLE Employee;

In this example, we’re marking all the extents of the Employee table for deallocation, so they’re considered empty for reuse.

Q3. What is DML? Explain INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE with an example. 
Ans.- DML is an abbreviation of Data Manipulation Language.The DML commands in Structured Query Language change the data present in the SQL database. We can easily access, store, modify, update and delete the existing records from the database using DML commands.

INSERT-It allows users to insert data in database tables.
Syntax:INSERT INTO TABLE_NAME ( column_Name1 , column_Name2 , column_Name3 , .... column_NameN )  VALUES (value_1, value_2, value_3, .... value_N );
Example:INSERT INTO Student (Stu_id, Stu_Name, Stu_Marks, Stu_Age) VALUES (104, Anmol, 89, 19);

UPDATE-It allows users to update or modify the existing data in database tables.
Syntax:UPDATE Table_name SET [column_name1= value_1, ….., column_nameN = value_N] WHERE CONDITION;
Example:UPDATE Product SET Product_Price = 80 WHERE Product_Id = 'P102' ;  

DELETE: DELETE is a DML command which allows SQL users to remove single or multiple existing records from the database tables.
Syntax:DELETE FROM Table_Name WHERE condition;  
Example:DELETE FROM Product WHERE Product_Id = 'P202' ;  

Q4. What is DQL? Explain SELECT with an example. 
Ans.-Stands for Data Query Language. The main purpose of the DQL command is to provide a schema according to the query written. 

SELECT-The SELECT statement in SQL is used to fetch or retrieve data from a database. It allows users to access the data and retrieve specific data based on specific conditions.
Syntax:SELECT column1,column2…. FROM table_name ;
Example:SELECT CustomerName, LastName FROM Customer;

Q5. Explain Primary Key and Foreign Key. 
Ans-What is Primary Key?
A primary key is used to ensure that data in the specific column is unique. A column cannot have NULL values. It is either an existing table column or a column that is specifically generated by the database according to a defined sequence. 

Example: STUD_NO, as well as STUD_PHONE both, are candidate keys for relation STUDENT but STUD_NO can be chosen as the primary key (only one out of many candidate keys). 
What is Foreign Key?
A foreign key is a column or group of columns in a relational database table that provides a link between data in two tables. It is a column (or columns) that references a column (most often the primary key) of another table. 

Example: STUD_NO in STUDENT_COURSE is a foreign key to STUD_NO in STUDENT relation. 


Q6. Write a python code to connect MySQL to python. Explain the cursor() and execute() method.
Ans- import mysql.connector
mydb=mysql.connector.connect(
    host="localhost",
    user="root",
    password="monikam9254@"


)
print(mydb)
mycursor=mydb.cursor()
mycursor.execute("SHOW DATABASES")
for x in mycursor:
    print(x)
    
cursor(): It is used to iterate row by row data in the table.
execute():It is used to run the SQL statements.


Q7. Give the order of execution of SQL clauses in an SQL query. 
The order of query execution in SQL is the order in which the various clauses in a SQL statement are executed. Generally, the order is as follows:

FROM clause
WHERE clause
GROUP BY clause
HAVING clause
SELECT clause
ORDER BY clause
LIMIT clause
